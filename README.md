Newsletter email code sample project

Intent:
This three-article newsletter was developed to be sent out once monthly to existing customers, promoting upcoming events and new product features. The offset two-column layout stacks and centers in mobile email clients and adjusts to full screen in all desktop email clients, including Microsoft Outlook.
