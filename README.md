# Email - Newsletter Starter File

Starter file for responsive email perfect for a monthly company newsletter. This three-article newsletter was developed to be sent out once monthly to existing customers, promoting upcoming events and new product features. The offset two-column layout stacks and centers in mobile email clients and adjusts to full screen in all desktop email clients, including Microsoft Outlook.

The email layout here was coded from scratch utilizing my email boilerplate framework (developed from Email on Acid and Litmus.com samples as a starting point). Email on Acid Tests passing in 44 popular mobile, web, and desktop email clients/devices as of August, 2021. All copyrights and trademarks remain property of their respective owners.
